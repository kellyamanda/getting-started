    to the basics of text, data, widgets, and visualizations. For more complex examples poke around on the
    [Streamlit forum](discuss.streamlit.io).

    ## Text
    Your basic functions for text are `st.title`, `st.header`, `st.subtitle`, and `st.write`.
    You can also use specialized functions like `st.markdown`, `st.text`, `st.code`, or `st.latex`. Here are some examples.

    ## Data

    The easiest way to write data is just to use the `st.write` function. You can also use `st.table` or `st.dataframe` for different layouts.

    #
    ## Visualizing Data

    So much data visualization! For charts there are some basic functions in Streamlit color_picker `st.line_chart`
    and `st.map`, but Streamlit also supports Altair, PyPlot, Vega Lite, Plotly, Bokeh, PyDeck, Seaborn and more.
    Check out the docs for [all the charting types](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/api.html?highlight=number_input#display-charts).

    ## Widgets

    Get your app interactive! Widgets are the core of building a great app. Streamlit offers a large number of widgets including
    `st.button`, `st.checkbox`, `st.radio`, `st.selectbox`, `st.multiselect`, `st.slider`, `st.text_input`, `st.date_input`, `st.number_input`, and [many more](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/api.html#display-interactive-widgets).

    use `st.set_page_config` to set a custom page title or favicon. Note that for `st.set_page_config` to work, it must be the very first Streamlit

    # Optimizing for app performance
    Your app looks good but it also needs to load and update quickly. Streamlit apps run just like Python scripts - from top to bottom - which
    means that anytime something changes in your app, like a widget changing a value, the whole script reruns. Streamlit does magic behind
    the scenes to make this run fast by default, but there are a few things you should do to help speed it up.

    ## @st.cache
    Any time you are loading in data, manipulating large datasets, or performing extensive computations you should think about creating a function
    and using the `@st.cache` decorator to store results in the local cache. That way the next time you call the cached function, Streamlit will
    skip executing the function and just returned the previously stored output. Which all makes your app much faster!

    Here is an example using ``@st.cache`:
    """

    st.code("""
    @st.cache
    def expensive_computation(a, b):
        time.sleep(2)  # This makes the function take 2s to run
        return a * b

    a = 2
    b = 21
    res = expensive_computation(a, b)

    st.write("Result:", res)

    """, language="python")

    """

    Note: `@st.cache` only works on functions. So make sure to put your data pull or computation in a function before using `@st.cache`.
    [Read more about @st.cache](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/caching.html) in our documentation.

    ## Using buttons and forms
    Sometimes you have a lot of widgets and you want to wait until everything has been adjusted and entered before running the computation.
    In that case `st.button` and `st.beta_form` are going to be your best friends.
